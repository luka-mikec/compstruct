# CompStruct project

### Computable structures, decidability and complexity

## Overview

The project is intended to help coordinate and support the activities of the Croatian group which carries out research in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. The envisioned topics of research are computability in analysis and topology and the decidability and complexity of various logics.

One of the main objectives of this project is the investigation of several aspects of computable analysis. In particular, it is planned to examine conditions under which a semicomputable set in a computable metric or topological space is computable. It is known that topology plays an important role in the description of such conditions. The investigations planned in this project should contribute to the further understanding of the relationship between computability and topology. Furthermore, this project will investigate various properties of computability structures on metric spaces, as well as the relationship between separable and maximal computability structures. It is also planned to examine, from the computability viewpoint, some properties of metric spaces on which certain geometric structure is given.

Interpretability logics are extensions of provability logic GL (Gödel-Löb). The main open question in the area is to determine the axiomatization of the logic _IL(All)_, i.e. the interpretability logic that is in the intersection of all the systems. In an attempt to answer this famous question, various extensions of the basic system IL were defined. The completeness of some extensions w.r.t. generalized Veltman semantics should be studied in this project. Further, we purpose to study decidability and complexity, and then we would like to consider implementation of algorithms for deciding provability. Particular consideration will be given to the complexity of some descriptive logics that are associated with the upgrades of the propositional dynamic logic and have application in databases.
